For this homework, you are a data scientist working for Pronto (before the end of their contract with the City of Seattle). Your job is to assist in determining how to do end-of-day adjustments in the number of bikes at stations so that all stations will, on the average of the year, have enough bikes for the next day of operation. Your assistance will help in constructing a plan for each day of the week that specifies how many bikes should be moved from each station and how many bikes must be delievered to each station.

Your assignment is to construct plots of the differences between 'from' and 'to' counts for each station by day of the week. Do this as a set of 7 subplots. You should use at least one function to construct our plots.
