# HW4 - Exceptions and Testing

You will implement the k-nearest neighbors algorithm for regression, along with appropriate exceptions and tests. K-nearest neighbors regression is a useful tool in machine learning.

We suggest that you commit your partial code after Step 2 and Step 3 in addition to after Step 4. This is an opportunity to checkpoint your work and practice test-driven development.

### 1. Create the directories.

Create two directories at the base directory of the homework repository: `knn` and `tests` [1pt].

### 2. Create a module in the `knn` folder named `knn.py`.

Inside `knn.py`, write a function interface, `knn_regression(n_neighbors, data, query)` for a function that implements the k-nearest neighbors algorithm for regression. (1pt)

At this time, write ONLY the interface. We are practicing test-driven development - write the interface first, then proceed to the next step, without any implementation. To make your code valid, you should return a dummy value or throw an exception, but you do not do a real computation until after you have written tests. Commit your code after this step.

The function takes 3 parameters:
1. Parameter `k`, or `n_neighbors`. `n_neighbors` must be an integer and must be greater than 0.
2. `data` - 2 dimensional numpy array of shape (m, **n+1**)). `m` denotes the number of samples and `n` is the number of variables in each sample. `+1` is for the labels in each sample - the last column in the sample. `m` must be at least as large as `n_neighbors`. `n` must be at least 1 (so the 2-dimensional array must be *at least* (m, 2)). All samples must have the same value of `n`. All samples and labels must be numeric.
3. `query` - 1 dimensional numpy array, shape (n,). `n` must be the same as in the `data` argument.

The function returns the predicted label for query (a single numeric value) or raises an appropriate exception (such as `TypeError` for when the type is wrong or `ValueError` when the content/shape of the input is wrong) when inappropriate inputs are passed for any argument (wrong type, wrong shape, or wrong value).

#### Example inputs and outputs

```
import numpy as np

n_neighbors = 3
data = np.array([[3, 1, 230],
                 [6, 2, 745],
                 [6, 6, 1080],
                 [4, 3, 495],
                 [2, 5, 260]])

query = np.array([5, 4])

knn_regression(n_neighbors, data, query)  # returns 773.33
```

This is a visualization of the example inputs.

### 3. Create a Python module `test_knn.py` inside the `tests` folder.

Inside `test_knn.py`, write a series of test cases to confirm the validity of your implementation in `Step 2`, using the `unittest` framework (1pt).

At the end of this step, most of your tests should be **failing** because you haven't written the implementation of the function yet!

These tests should contain:

a. At least one *smoke* test (1pt).

b. At least two *one-shot* tests, BOTH of which are DIFFERENT from the example we gave above. It would be a good idea to test the provided example, too, but it still does NOT count for your two one-shot tests. Pattern tests are acceptable, but each pattern tests counts as only one one-shot test (2pt).

c. All appropriate *edge* tests you find useful for the algorithm (at least four) (2 pts).

Use a `__main__` block to run the tests (1pt). You should be able to run the unit tests from the ROOT of your repository using the commands `python -m unittest discover` and `python -m tests.test_knn`.

Note that the creation of data to test your function is up to you. Other than the example above, we do not provide a dataset, but we HIGHLY recommend that you come up with a few more complicated examples on your own, because the example above will not exercise all the situations.

Commit your code after this step.

### 4. Implement `knn_regression` to calculate the k-nearest neighbors algorithm.

(2 pts for algorithm, 2 pts for exceptions)

We are not grading your homework based on computational complexity or on dimensionality larger than 4, so don't worry about inefficient algorithms. You may NOT use an existing library to do your k-nearest-neighbors calculation automatically. Do not do any rounding.

At the end of this step, if you rerun the tests, your tests should now be passing.

#### Pseudocode for kNN Regression

```
A. For each example in the data:

    A.1 Calculate the distance between the query example and the current example
        from the data. Check out the `math` module, which has a function which can
        help you find the distance between two points.
    
    A.2 Add the distance and the label of the current example to an ordered
        collection (ie a list).

B. Sort the ordered collection of distances and labels from smallest to largest (in
   ascending order) by the distances. Hint: check out Python's sorting documentation -
   The itemgetter function might be helpful here.

C. Pick the first K entries from the sorted collection.

D. Get the labels of the selected K entries.

E. Return the mean of the K labels. Mean is defined as summing up all the labels,
   then dividing by K.
```
